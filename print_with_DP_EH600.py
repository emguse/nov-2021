    ### Print for the DP-EH600 using the 'thermalprinter' module.
    - need to set serial to 'ON' and serial console to 'OFF' in raspi-config.
    - If you do not use RTS/CTS for flow control, please limit the image height.
    - The output is not sent as serial characters via printer commands, but as an image using the Pillow module.
    - The output is not limited to the fonts owned by the printer, but can be in any typeface and language you like.
